# B2BPayments Protocol

## Project Description

B2BPayments Protocol is a decentralized cross-border business payment solution built on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts. The protocol enables businesses to send and receive international payments with significantly reduced fees and faster settlement times compared to traditional banking systems.

The protocol eliminates intermediary banks, reduces transaction costs from 3-7% to just 0.5%, and settles payments in minutes rather than days. It features automatic escrow functionality, business verification systems, and transparent fee structures, making it ideal for international trade, supplier payments, and cross-border commerce.
